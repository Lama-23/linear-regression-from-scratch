# linear-regression-from-scratch
This project implements Linear Regression, a fundamental Supervised Machine Learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. The goal is to model the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (X).

## 1. The Mathematical Model
The model assumes a linear relationship:

Where:
- X: Feature matrix.
* θ(Theta): The parameter vector (Weights and Bias).
+ y: Target/Output vector.
